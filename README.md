### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! Iâ€™m Sydney, a 19 year old artist! Iâ€™ve been doing art for 8 years. I am looking for a career in Game Design or Digital Art. I specialize in digital art, using Clip Studio Paint and a Huion Tablet, but I enjoy experimenting with other mediums! I've collaborated with other people for several different projects and I'm actively looking for other experience opportunities. I currently am a student at Florida State University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts.

My current projects: Creating my own RPG video game, 3d printing and painting costume props, working on a digital art project on mental health

Currently learning: coding

Ask me about: My digital art and Global Game Jam competition!

How to reach me: I'm typically available at thesydneygraham17@gmail.com. I'll typically get back to you in about 1-2 days.

Pronouns: she/her/hers

Fun fact: I play 6 instruments! Piano, drums, guitar, ukelele, kalimba, and singing!
